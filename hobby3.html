        <h2>Exploring the Tech World</h2>
        <p>Building computers is another main hobby of mine. In total I have built 9 Computers.
            They have always fascinated me, even programming. This all started
            at a very young age due to my grandfather, he is the main reason
            I got into this field of study. He would always program or was working on some kind of computer
            and because of that I got interested on what he was working on and decided to learn more, beside him.
            Computers may be a hobby but it is an extremely passionate hobby of mine
        </p>
        <p>Not only do I program and build computers,
            but I also like to explore the latest innovation in tech,
            it alwats surprises me the new things that can be made or improved on
            in the tech world. 
        </p>
