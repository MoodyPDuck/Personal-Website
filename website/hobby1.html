        <h2>Discovering Worlds Through Pages</h2>
        <p>Reading has been a passion of mine for a 
            very long time. Whether it's reading into
             a fantasy series, exploring thrillers and mysteries, 
             or even delving into thought-provoking non-fiction, books 
             have always been and will always be my escape from reality into new worlds.</p>

        <p> The image above is a very early image that shows my manga collection which has grown with the addition of books as well.
            As you can see from the image above I have a few books ranging into different categories. What is not shown in this image
            are some other books I have such as Hunger Games, many works from Osamu Dazai, and various other authors.
            I am also one that enjoys manga. Among these, my favorites would
            have to be the Red Rising series, No longer Human, as well as Berserk.
